% Abstract (Do not use inserted blank lines, i.e. \\) 
\abstract{The deployment of small unmanned aircraft to collect in-situ vertical measurements of the atmospheric state in conjunction with other meteorological observations has the potential to significantly expand our weather observation capabilities. We briefly report on a concept of adding the capability of collecting vertical atmospheric measurements (profiles) through the use of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) at sites deemed suitable for this application.  The system must be able to operate unattended, which necessitates the inclusion of risk mitigation measures such as detect and avoid radar and the ability to transmit and receive transponder signals. It is also necessary for the system to be capable of assessing local weather conditions (visibility, surface winds, cloud height) and the integrity of the vehicle (system diagnostics, fuel level) before takeoff. We begin by providing a notional concept of operations for a 3D Mesonet and a description of the technical configuration for one such station in the network. We then report on progress being made to develop and test a prototype 3D Mesonet station and show preliminary measurements and discuss how such measurements from an operational network could be utilized to better characterize the atmospheric boundary layer, improve weather forecasts, and help to identify threats of severe weather.}

\section{How to Use this Template}

The template details the sections that can be used in a manuscript. Sections that are not mandatory are listed as such. The section titles given are for Articles. Review papers and other article types have a more flexible structure. For any questions, please contact the editorial office of the journal or support@mdpi.com. For LaTeX related questions please contact Janine Daum at latex-support@mdpi.com.

\section{Introduction}

The introduction should briefly place the study in a broad context and highlight why it is important. It should define the purpose of the work and its significance. The current state of the research field should be reviewed carefully and key publications should be cited. Please highlight controversial and diverging hypotheses when necessary. Finally, briefly mention the main aim of the work and highlight the main conclusions. As far as possible, please keep the introduction comprehensible to scientists outside your particular field of research. Citing a journal paper \cite{ref-journal}. And now citing a book reference \cite{ref-book}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results}

This section may be divided by subheadings. It should provide a concise and precise description of the experimental results, their interpretation as well as the experimental conclusions that can be drawn.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Subsection}
\subsubsection{Subsubsection}

Bulleted lists look like this:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,labelsep=4mm]
\item	First bullet
\item	Second bullet
\item	Third bullet
\end{itemize}

Numbered lists can be added as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*,labelsep=3mm]
\item	First item
\item	Second item
\item	Third item
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Figures, Tables and Schemes}

All figures and tables should be cited in the main text as Figure 1, Table 1, etc.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{This is a figure, Schemes follow the same formatting. If there are multiple panels, they should be listed as: (\textbf{a}) Description of what is contained in the first panel. (\textbf{b}) Description of what is contained in the second panel. Figures should be placed in the main text near to the first time they are cited. A caption on a single line should be centered.}
\end{figure}   

\begin{table}[H]

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Formatting of Mathematical Components}

This is an example of an equation:

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{S}
\end{equation}

%% If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph. 
Please punctuate equations as regular text. Theorem-type environments (including propositions, lemmas, corollaries etc.) can be formatted as follows:
%% Example of a theorem:
\begin{Theorem}
Example text of a theorem.
\end{Theorem}
The text continues here. Proofs must be formatted as follows:

%% Example of a proof:
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem 1]
Text of the proof. Note that the phrase `of Theorem 1' is optional if it is clear which theorem is being referred to.
\end{proof}

\section{Discussion}

This section may be divided by subheadings. Authors should discuss the results and how they can be interpreted in perspective of previous studies and of the working hypotheses. The findings and their implications should be discussed in the broadest context possible. Future research directions may also be highlighted.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Materials and Methods}

This section should be divided by subheadings. Materials and Methods should be described with sufficient details to allow others to replicate and build on published results. Please note that publication of your manuscript implicates that you must make all materials, data, and protocols associated with the publication available to readers. Please disclose at the submission stage any restrictions on the availability of materials or information. New methods and protocols should be described in detail while well-established methods can be briefly described and appropriately cited.

Research manuscripts reporting large datasets that are deposited in a publicly available database should specify where the data have been deposited and provide the relevant accession numbers. If the accession numbers have not yet been obtained at the time of submission, please state that they will be provided during review. They must be provided prior to publication.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusions}

This section is not mandatory, but can be added to the manuscript if the discussion is unusually long or complex.

\appendix
\section{}
The appendix is an optional section that can contain details and data supplemental to the main text. For example, explanations of experimental details that would disrupt the flow of the main text, but nonetheless remain crucial to understanding and reproducing the research shown; figures of replicates for experiments of which representative data is shown in the main text can be added here if brief, or as Supplementary data. Mathemtaical proofs of results not central to the paper can be added as an appendix.

\section{}
All appendix sections must be cited in the main text. In the appendixes, Figures, Tables, etc. should be labeled starting with `A', e.g., Figure A1, Figure A2, etc.
